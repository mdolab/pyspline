C***DESCRIPTION
C        ***Note*** Machine Dependent Routine
C        FDUMP is intended to be replaced by a locally written
C        version which produces a symbolic dump.  Failing this,
C        it should be replaced by a version which prints the
C        subprogram nesting list.  Note that this dump must be
C        printed on each of up to five files, as indicated by the
C        XGETUA routine.  See XSETUA and XGETUA for details.
